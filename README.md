**Profile Image Generator**

This JavaScript/TypeScript utility generates unique profile images for user avatars based on their usernames. The functionality includes dynamically creating a canvas, applying a random background color, generating a legible text color, and rendering the user's initial. The generated image can be used both as an `img` tag source for UI display and as a `File` object for backend uploads. The utility provides an easy way to enhance user experience with personalized and visually appealing avatars.
